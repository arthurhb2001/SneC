# SneC++

A snake game written in C++ using SDL3.

## Build instructions

There are two ways to build, using `build.bat` and through Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.
Either way, you will need Visual Studio 2022 installed alongside the desktop C++ development tools to build.
If building through Visual Studio, it is recommended to run `download-sdl.ps1` first to download and extract dependencies.
